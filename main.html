                    <h3>How can I submit my entry for the contests?</h3>

                <div class="faq-box">
                    <h3>Can I submit more than one entry?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can submit more than one entry for the contest, but only one program per user can win. To enter another program, you will need to make another spin-off of the contest announcement page.</p>

                    <p>Using alternate accounts is discouraged as it makes verifying originality very difficult. You can post your finished project to your alternate account but for the contest entry, use the account you do most of your work in.</p>

                <div class="faq-box">
                    <h3>Can I submit a program I have already made?</h3>
                    <p>No. All entries need to be made after the contest is released. Using a program you have already created would give you an unfair advantage over the rest of the competition, and we want the contests to be fair!</p>

                    <p>You may use code blocks that you previously wrote in your entry as long as you clearly indicate with comments what code was previously written and where it came from. Please note that we will only judge code written after the start of the contest, so the previously written code should not be a significant part of your project.</p>

                    <p>Drawing tools are allowed, but they have to be used minimally, and you need to disclose in comments which parts were made with the tool. Your entire project shouldn't be made with a drawing tool.</p>

                    <p>Entries will be judged following the end of the contest. We are a small team and have to work around many peoples' schedules, so we ask that you please be patient while we judge the entries. Results are normally posted 1-2 weeks after the deadline.</p>

                    <p>All entries will be sorted into 3 skill brackets---Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each skill bracket is judged separately, and winners are selected from each bracket. In order to ensure the system remains fair, we don't disclose the criteria for placing programs in the skill brackets.</p>

For this contest we are going to depart from the normal type of contest to go on an imaginary job interview!</p><p>Walking into a manufacturing company looking for software development work might include the interviewer asking you to sit down and use their computer/software to solve a programming problem. That is what this contest is simulating. An imaginary production equipment manufacturer that makes robotic arms and other production machinery needs a software developer to write the software that is the brains of their production equipment.</p><p>There are three skill levels as listed in the contest code. Pick one (or more) levels and fill in the missing code that will make the machinery do its task. The deadline for this contest is December 26th, 2020. We will judge in the week after that, awarding winners based on creativity, efficiency, and clean, commented code.</p><p>This is a new type of contest and we would welcome your comments and feedback in the Tips & Thanks section below. If there is enough interest, we could add another contest some time next year to perhaps give you a version 1 application, and let you add features or creative improvements to make it a version 2 application, or other such ideas. Feel free to let us know what you think of this contest type (good or bad).</p><p>All entries should be submitted as a spin-off of this project. Attribute any parts of your entry that you didn't write. Most importantly, have fun!</p>",

But why?</p><p>Computers are becoming a big part of our lives these days, from normal home usage, to medicine, to transportation, to learning new things about our world, computers and robots are starting to do more and more things for society. By taking over tasks that can be dangerous for humans to do, and other more monotonous jobs, humans can have more time to learn, discover, and invent even better technology.</p><p>For this month's contest, make a program that shows one or more ways computer science can help us in becoming more technologically advanced and in solving world problems. You can pick either an existing technological invention that is doing good in the world, or you can propose your own ideas for future technology!</p><p>For this contest, we'll also be accepting webpage entries. If you'd like to submit a webpage entry, please save your code as a spin-off of the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/contest-computer-science-for-good-webpage-submissions/6362796654559232\" target=\"_blank\">webpage submission program</a>. Otherwise, you can submit a ProcessingJS entry as a spin-off of this program, as usual.</p><p>Deadline is December 27, 2019. We will judge in the week after that, and award based on creativity, complexity, and clean commented code. The top winners in each skill bracket will receive a Golden Winston. Attribute any parts of your code you didn't write, and most importantly, have fun!</p>",

This month's theme is Seasons. The powerful cycle of seasons drives all life on the planet and, depending on your species, dictates optimal times to migrate, hibernate, mate, rear young, plant crops, and almost any activity you can think of. We urban humans might think seasons are for our amusement but if farmers were not finely tuned to the seasons famine and mass starvation would result. Write a program that illustrates, animates, simulates, etc. some aspect of the seasons: What's your favorite season and why? Why are there seasons? What are the physical, biological, behavioral, or cultural effects of seasons? Will the character of seasons continue to change over time (e.g. Milankovitch cycles)? Are there seasons on other planets? Would meaningful life forms have evolved without seasons?</p><p>Deadline is July 28th. We will judge in the week after that, and award based on creativity, complexity, and clean, commented code. Projects should be submitted as spin-offs of this project. The top winners in each skill bracket will receive a Golden Winston.</p><p>Attribute any parts of your code you didn't write, and most importantly, have fun! The weather may be extreme but you'll know why!</p>",

                    description: "<p>π day is March 14 (3.14) and to help celebrate one of the deepest mathematical constants, combine math and code to generate as many digits of π as possible while creatively displaying the results and perhaps visualizing the processes used. Computing digits of π is one of the most computationally intensive tasks known. There have been numerous (and surprising) techniques developed to compute π. The methods used by the ancients involving comparing the perimeters of polygons inscribed and circumscribed around a unit circle may be intuitive but are extremely inefficient (e.g. Archimedes only gets 2 places to the right of the decimal using 96 sided polygons)</p><p>Research the current ways that π can be computed and document as comments in your code your sources of information. There are a number of key challenges you will encounter in this environment. Numbers in Javascript are limited to 53 bits of precision or a bit less than 16 decimal digits which means that your chosen technique will require unlimited precision arithmetic or else an algorithm that generates digits directly. The Processing.JS environment prevents infinite loops via a system timer. You will need to structure your algorithm to perform a finite amount of work for each invocation of the draw function in order to keep \"Oh noes\" from stopping your program!</p><p>Deadline is March 28th. We will judge in the week after that, and award based on creativity, complexity, and clean, commented code. Projects should be submitted as spin-offs of this project. The top winners in each skill bracket will receive a Golden Winston.</p><p>Attribute any parts of your code you didn't write, and most importantly, have fun! It may not be a piece of cake but you'll have your own piece of pi.</p>",
